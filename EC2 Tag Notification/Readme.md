# Notify Subscribers about missing EC2 tags
## ðŸ“ŒProject Overview
The purpose of this project is to ensure that all EC2 instances in your AWS environment have the necessary tags, specifically the `Environment` tag. Proper tagging of resources is crucial for effective cost management, resource organization, and compliance. This solution automatically checks all running EC2 instances and sends an email notification to subscribed users if any instance is missing the required tag.
### Why is tagging important?
* **Cost Allocation**: Helps in identifying and managing costs associated with specific projects or environments.
* **Resource Organization**: Makes it easier to filter and manage resources in a large-scale environment.
* **Automation and Compliance**: Ensures that instances adhere to tagging policies, enabling automation and compliance checks.
