## Serverless Web Application using Lambda, Dynamo DB, S3 and CloudFront
### Project Overview
In this project we will build a serverless web application which will allow users to create, update, read and delete (CURD) items from a DynamoDB table. We will be utilizing a Lambda function URL for backend interaction without the need for an API Gateway. The app leverages various AWS services to ensure high availability, scalability, and secure content delivery, with a real-time view counter that tracks website visits.
