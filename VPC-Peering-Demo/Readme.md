# VPC Peering Connection demo
## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to establish connectivity between two distinct AWS Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) using VPC Peering. This setup allows instances in different VPCs to communicate with each other privately without using an internet gateway, VPN, or other AWS networking services. VPC Peering provides a secure, low-latency, and scalable method of communication between VPCs across the same or different AWS accounts and regions.
