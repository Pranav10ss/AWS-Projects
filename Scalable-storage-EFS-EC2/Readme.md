# Building a Scalable Storage Solution with AWS EFS and EC2
## Project Overview
In this project, we design and implement a Scalable Storage Solution using AWS Elastic File System (EFS) and EC2 instances. The project demonstrates a solution that requires a centralized, scalable, and highly available storage solution for managing large volumes of files. By leveraging EFS, we can achieve a fully managed, elastic, and high-performance shared file system that can be accessed by multiple EC2 instances deployed across different Availability Zones (AZs).
