# Monitoring Memory utilization of EC2 using cloudwatch
## Objective of this project
This project demonstrates how to monitor the memory utilization of an Amazon EC2 instance using Amazon CloudWatch. By default, CloudWatch monitors metrics like CPU usage, disk I/O, and network, but it does not monitor memory usage out of the box. This project shows how to set up the CloudWatch agent to send custom memory utilization metrics from an EC2 instance to CloudWatch.
